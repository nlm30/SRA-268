The uses of different colors, red and blue, for each measure differentiates them to the reader’s eyes and twells them they are looking at separate variables. While there is not much variation in the average winning points for each team, there is significant variation in the average winning seed. This gives the reader an idea of how good each team is on average. For example, the Dukes average winning seed is 15, indicating they usually only make the tournament by getting their conference’s automatic bid. Meanwhile the duck  average a winning seed less than five, indicating they likely do not need an automatic bid to make the tournament.  "

        "This graph shows the correlation between mascot name and the amount of points scored. The correlation is depicted through the size and color of the bubble. For example, a large and dark green bubble indicates a greater amount of points scored for that mascot. A major factor that impacts this graph is common mascot names. For example, there are many schools with “Wildcat” mascot and so their points totals were lumped together. Meanwhile, very few schools have a spider for a mascot. Another factor is how often a team makes the tournament. Since this graph uses a sum rather than average, more tournament appearances will continue to add points to the total and increase the bubble size. "

The graph shows that a usual winning score will fall somewhere in the range of 65 - 85 points. This encompasses the three largest bars.

        "This graph depicts scoring on a year to year basis. Starting in 1985 and ending in 2017 each bar represents the average total points per game for that year. The color of each bar indicates the magnitude of the scores. For example, the darker the bar the higher the score. By looking at this graph it is possible to examine how scoring trends change over time. There is a slight rise and fall cycle that repeats every few years. This shows the responsive nature of the sport and the battle between offense and defense. As offense and point totals increase, eventually coaches respond with better defensive schemes, which drive down scoring until offense responds again. In 2017 scoring was up so based on the pattern it would lead to the conclusion scoring will fall in the next couple years.    \n"
